# React + Vite

One of the core principles of React.js is its component-based architecture. React allows you to break down your user interface into reusable components, which can be easily composed and combined to create complex UIs. This modular approach brings several advantages, including improved code reusability, easier maintenance, and better collaboration among developers. With React.js, you can build scalable and maintainable applications, saving time and effort throughout the development lifecycle.


Virtual DOM for Enhanced Performance:
React.js introduces the concept of a Virtual DOM (Document Object Model), which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. By using a Virtual DOM, React minimizes direct manipulation of the real DOM, leading to improved performance and faster rendering. React efficiently updates only the necessary parts of the DOM, resulting in a smoother and more responsive user interface. This optimized approach makes React.js an excellent choice for building high-performance web applications that can handle complex UI interactions seamlessly.


React.js allows for server-side rendering, making your web application more search engine friendly. With server-side rendering, search engine crawlers can easily access the content of your website, leading to better visibility in search engine results. but next.js is a react framework which is more efficient in SEO (search engine optomization)
